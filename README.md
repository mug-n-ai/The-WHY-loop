# The WHY Loop

**A structured reasoning framework to go from goals to actions – by Lorenzo Mugnai**

The WHY Loop helps you clarify any goal, identify what's truly needed, and distinguish what works from what doesn't – by asking *Why?* at every level. It's designed to turn complex ideas into feasible, traceable decisions.

## 🔄 Structure

1. **GOAL** – What do you want to achieve? Why?
2. **NEEDS** – What must be true or available to reach that goal? Why?
3. **STRATEGIC BIFURCATION** – For each need:
   - ✅ What could help? Why would it work? Under what assumptions?
   - ❌ What could fail? Why might it fail? What makes it risky?

Valid actions emerge only from solid chains of logic. The WHY Loop is recursive: each action can be tested again using the same structure.
