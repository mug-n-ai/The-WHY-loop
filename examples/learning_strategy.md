# Case Study: University Learning Strategy – Applying the WHY Loop Framework

### 1. Context and Relevance

A second-year university student is struggling to pass a core subject in their engineering degree. Despite putting in many hours of study, their results remain poor. The student feels frustrated and overwhelmed, and starts doubting their abilities.

This is a common scenario where effort alone does not translate into outcome, and a structured analysis is needed to identify what actually matters. The WHY Loop helps move from frustration to adaptive learning design.

### 2. Application of the WHY Loop

#### GOAL

**What do you want to achieve?**  
Pass the upcoming mathematics exam with at least a grade of 24/30.

**Why?**  
Because it’s a core requirement for progression, and I want to feel competent in foundational topics.

---

#### NEEDS

- Identify the actual concepts I don’t understand  
- Practise in a way that improves retention and exam performance  
- Reduce anxiety during study and test conditions  
- Create a realistic plan given time and energy limits

---

#### STRATEGIC BIFURCATION – Focus on identifying what I don’t understand

**3A. What could help?**

- Attempt old exam questions and track where I fail  
  → *Why would it work?* Shows gaps between what I know and what’s expected  
  → *Conditions:* I have access to past exams and can self-evaluate or get help

- Join a peer study group  
  → *Why would it work?* Others may explain concepts I struggle with  
  → *Assumption:* The group is well-organised and supportive

→ Student chooses to start with solo review, then validate with one group session per week

---

**3B. What could work against it?**

- Passive rereading of notes without testing  
  → *Why might it fail?* Creates illusion of understanding  
  → *What makes it risky?* Reinforces ineffective strategies

→ Sub-loop: Redesign study habits to include active recall and spaced repetition

---

#### Iteration: Reducing anxiety

**Need**: Create a calming pre-exam ritual to manage emotional spikes

**What could help?**

- Breathing exercise 10 minutes before studying and before exams  
- Practice writing mock exams under timed conditions

→ Result: student experiences improved focus and reduced panic moments during testing

### 3. Discussion

The WHY Loop helped the student isolate the core dysfunction: effort was being invested into *familiar* tasks instead of *necessary* ones. It exposed passive learning patterns and enabled new experiments based on direct feedback. Iterating on both emotional and cognitive needs built a more sustainable path to competence.

Instead of doubling down on willpower, the student applied strategic reasoning – with measurable improvements in performance and confidence.
