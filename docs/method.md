# The Method

The WHY Loop is a structured reasoning tool designed to move from abstract goals to grounded, testable actions.  
It guides you through a recursive process of asking **‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù** at each step ‚Äî to clarify, challenge, and validate your thinking.

---

## Overview of the Loop

The WHY Loop is composed of **three main steps** and can be read:

- Top-down ‚Äî for analysis and planning  
- Bottom-up ‚Äî for execution and action

![WHY Loop Diagram](diagram.png)

Each step serves a precise function in turning intention into informed action.

---

## 1. GOAL ‚Äî What do you want to achieve? Why?

:::tip
Start with a goal that is clear, meaningful, and measurable.
:::

Ask yourself:

- What outcome am I aiming for?
- What does success look like?
- Why is this worth pursuing?

This step sets direction.  
If the goal is vague or inherited without questioning, the rest of the structure collapses.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    %% main block WHY Loop Cell
    GOAL(["GOAL<br/>What do you want to achieve?<br/><b>Why</b> do you want to achieve it?"])

   classDef cell fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ccc,stroke-width:1px;
   class GOAL cell;

```

---

## 2. NEEDS ‚Äî What must be true to reach the goal?

Break your goal into necessary conditions:

- What must be in place for this to happen?
- Are there skills, knowledge, tools, beliefs, or people required?
- Why are these truly necessary?

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    %% main block WHY Loop Cell
    GOAL(["GOAL<br/>What do you want to achieve?<br/><b>Why</b> do you want to achieve it?"])
    NEEDS(["NEEDS<br/>What do you need to achieve your goal?<br/><b>Why</b> do you need to satisfy this?"])

    %% logical connections 
    GOAL --> NEEDS

   classDef cell fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ccc,stroke-width:1px;
    class GOAL,NEEDS cell;

```

:::note
This step maps the logical dependencies that underpin your goal.
If even one need is unsatisfiable, the goal may need to be revised or broken down.
:::

---

## 3. STRATEGIC BIFURCATION ‚Äî What helps, what hinders?

Each need is examined from two sides:

**A. What could help?**  

- What actions, tools, ideas, or strategies might satisfy the need?  
- Why would they work?  
- Under what conditions?

**B. What could work against it?**  

- What makes this fragile, risky, or uncertain?  
- Why might this fail?

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    %% main block WHY Loop Cell
    GOAL(["GOAL<br/>What do you want to achieve?<br/><b>Why</b> do you want to achieve it?"])
    NEEDS(["NEEDS<br/>What do you need to achieve your goal?<br/><b>Why</b> do you need to satisfy this?"])
    HELP(["What would <b>help</b> you to satisfy the need?<br/><b>Why</b> would this help?"])
    RISK(["What would <b>work against</b> the need?<br/><b>Why</b> would it work against?"])

    %% logical connections 
    GOAL --> NEEDS
    NEEDS --> HELP
    NEEDS --> RISK

   classDef cell fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ccc,stroke-width:1px;
   class GOAL,NEEDS,HELP,RISK cell;

```

:::tip
This dual approach prevents blind spots and overconfidence.  
It builds a balanced view before acting.

## Identifying Actions

From the bifurcation, you derive **valid actions**:

- If **help** is feasible and not overly complex, it becomes an action.
- If **risk** can be avoided, that avoidance is also an action.
- If a need is too complex or uncertain, open a new WHY Loop Cell to explore it further.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    %% main block WHY Loop Cell
    GOAL(["GOAL<br/>What do you want to achieve?<br/><b>Why</b> do you want to achieve it?"])
    NEEDS(["NEEDS<br/>What do you need to achieve your goal?<br/><b>Why</b> do you need to satisfy this?"])
    HELP(["What would <b>help</b> you to satisfy the need?<br/><b>Why</b> would this help?"])
    RISK(["What would <b>work against</b> the need?<br/><b>Why</b> would it work against?"])

    %% logical connections 
    GOAL --> NEEDS
    NEEDS --> HELP
    NEEDS --> RISK

    %% HELP side bifurcation
    HELP --> DIFF{Is it difficult to achieve?}
    DIFF -->|NO| ACT1[/"‚úÖ This is an action"/]
    DIFF -->|YES| NEWCELL["Start a new WHY Loop Cell<br/><i>Break down complexity or test feasibility</i>"]

    %% RISK side bifurcation
    RISK --> AVOID{Is it possible to avoid?}
    AVOID -->|YES| ACT2[/"‚úÖ Avoid this: it is an action"/]
    AVOID -->|NO| FAIL["üö´ The GOAL cannot be achieved.<br/>This need cannot be satisfied.<br/>The goal must be re-evaluated."]

    %% Annotations
    classDef cell fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ccc,stroke-width:1px;
    class GOAL,NEEDS,HELP,RISK cell;

```

## Unsatisfiable Needs

:::caution
If no viable strategy can be found for a need:
> The goal must be revised, decomposed, or abandoned.
:::

This protects you from investing time or energy in goals that are structurally impossible.

---

## Recursive and Iterative Use

Every action generated by the loop can itself become a new WHY Loop.

- Want to apply for funding? Use the loop.  
- Want to prepare your proposal? Use the loop.  
- Want to decide between two projects? Use the loop.

:::note
The WHY Loop is scalable.  
It can be used at any level: personal, team, organizational, or strategic.

## Reading the WHY Loop in Two Directions

The WHY Loop is not just a way to plan@ it‚Äôs a way to think.

You can **read it top-down** to clarify what you're aiming for, what must be true, and what might help or hinder your progress.
This direction is for analysis and construction: it helps identify the real problem and the actions that follow from it.

But you can also **read it bottom-up** to execute.
Starting from an action, trace your way back through the chain of needs and goals, verifying that what you‚Äôre doing still makes sense.
This direction is for validation and coherence: it confirms whether an action is aligned with its purpose.

Top-down: **What must be true**?
Bottom-up: **Why does this matter**?

This dual flow makes the WHY Loop both a creative and a critical tool, to build, and to test.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    GOAL["üéØ GOAL<br/>What do you want to achieve?"] 
    NEEDS["üîé NEEDS<br/>What must be true to reach it?"] 
    BIFUR["‚öñÔ∏è BIFURCATION<br/>What helps? What hinders?"] 
    ACTIONS["üöÄ ACTIONS<br/>What can you do?"]

    GOAL --> NEEDS
    NEEDS --> BIFUR
    BIFUR --> ACTIONS

    ACTIONS -.-> BIFUR
    BIFUR -.-> NEEDS
    NEEDS -.-> GOAL

    COMMENT_TOP["‚¨áÔ∏è <b>Top-down</b><br/>Build from goals"]
    COMMENT_BOTTOM["‚¨ÜÔ∏è <b>Bottom-up</b><br/>Justify from actions"]

    COMMENT_TOP --> GOAL
    ACTIONS --> COMMENT_BOTTOM

    classDef upstroke stroke-dasharray: 5 5,stroke:#999;
    class ACTIONS,BIFUR,NEEDS,GOAL upstroke;

```

## The Importance of ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù

Asking **Why?** is the engine of the entire method. It:

- Forces clarity over vagueness
- Surfaces hidden assumptions
- Avoids elegant but useless solutions
- Reinforces internal coherence
- Justifies every step with intent

:::info
Without a clear "Why", every action risks being misaligned with reality.

## How to Use the WHY Loop

You can apply it in many contexts: decisions, project design, team planning, coaching, writing.

Here‚Äôs a basic sequence:

1. Identify your goal  
2. Map out the needs that must be true  
3. For each need, ask:  
   - What could help?  
   - What could hinder?  
4. Mark any unsatisfiable needs  
5. Extract the viable actions (3A)  
6. Re-apply the loop if any action is vague or complex

:::tip
Use metrics only if your context requires measurement.  
The WHY Loop works without them by design.
